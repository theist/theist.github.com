    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi. I never got used to write down a blog. Well once I wrote one, I did it in php to learn that languaje and it was in the spirit of bloxsom, a blog which rendered text files as posts. when it was almost finished, I got it online and newer write a post on it. From then I had a wordpress a tumblr, and some other blogs. All of them empty or almost.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now I’m testing this Octopress stuff. I really like its spirit, static files served from github or other sites, generated by rake tasks. This is not the old txt file to post from bloxsom but it’s an approach that lets me write my post on vim, check it, and upload when it’s fine.</p>
